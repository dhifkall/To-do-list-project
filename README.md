# TODO List Project

This is a project for the Justice Redeemed Boot Camp

The goal of this project is to create a dynamic TODO list in the browser. You will use JavaScript to add items to the page, alongside CSS to style and format the HTML.

Steps:

1. Clone the project using Git
2. Create your own repository in GitHub
3. `git remote add origin git@github.com:<your_github_username>/<your_repo_name>.git`
4. Complete the project!

You should be able to add a TODO item:

Mark a TODO as done:

Remove TODOs from the list:

The layout for the project should look like below:

## Notes

- Clicking the X icon should remove the TODO block
- Clicking anywhere else on the block should toggle the status of that TODO
- Blocks should be of equal size. If text is too long to show, it should be cut off.

## Hints:

- Use the CSS box-shadow property to give your TODO blocks more depth.
  - Increase the shadow size on hover to give a popup effect
- The form element has an event that is triggered when you click on the submit button
